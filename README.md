# What are shared drives?
You can use shared drives in Google Drive to store, search, and access files with a team. Shared drive files belong to the team instead of an individual. Even if members leave, the files stay in place so your team can keep sharing information and work anywhere, from any device.
# Caution⚠
Before you create one shared drive...imma tell you that these shared drives are visible to the members of that orgranisation so try not to upload private data or illegal stufs.
